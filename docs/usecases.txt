On a home machine:
-----------------

Alice is logged in and starts a distribution upgrade and walks away, screen saver kicks in.
Bob fast-user-switches to his account, does some work and clicks shutdown.

ATM-> machine will suspend in middle of distribution upgrade

Desired behaviour: the procedure (running as root) should inhibit suspend behavior until it is finished (probably with some sort of polling method). When Bob tries to suspend, he should be informed that the dist-upgrade  (by Alice) is in process and the suspend could not be done at this time (and possibly be offered the option to suspend when it has)

---------------------------

Bob is logged in and starts a large download, epiphany makes request to ohm that the machine is not shutdown for the duration of the download.
Alice fast-user-switches to her account, does some stuff and clicks shutdown
Alice is informed that Bob is in the process of a large download, howver as she has admin rights she can override Bob's request and shuts the machine down

---------------------------

Embedded System
---------------
video player is started and requests processor core low latancy behaviour from ohm power management plugin.
power managemnt plugin approves an increase in cpu speed as battery level is not low.
heat management plugin reads from its temperature probes that processor core is nearly out of it operating temp range, and denies the request

---------------------------

In the lastest temperature probe readings, the heat management plugin notes that the board temperature over the battery is getting too hot, so requests a overal drop in power consumption from the power management plugin
