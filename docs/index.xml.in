        OHM is a small open source systems daemon which sits above HAL and
        abstracts out common hardware management tasks such as system wide
        inhibit action control and controlling heat dissipation on embedded
        devices.
        OHM is built using a lightweight plugin architecture.
        Each plugin can query data from HAL or execute methods on HAL devices
        and expose preferences for session programs to modify. 
        OHM is product and vendor neutral and is currently being developed by
        a small team of developers.
